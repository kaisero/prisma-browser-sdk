# Pagination

List endpoints return one page at a time. The `list(...)` wrapper method accepts
`all_pages=True`, which transparently follows the cursor and returns a single
response whose `.data` holds every item across all pages.

```python
from prisma_browser.extras.facade import Client

client = Client.from_env()

for item in client.application.list(all_pages=True).data:
    print(item)
```

Without `all_pages` (the default), `list(...)` returns just the first page — call it
again with the next cursor to page manually. With `all_pages=True` the wrapper fetches
every page for you; the server decides the page size. To cap the work, break out of the
loop once you have what you need.
